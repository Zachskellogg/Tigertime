            <li> Tigers are the largest cat species in the world and the third-largest carnivore on land--only polar and brown bears are larger.</li>
               <li> An adult Amur or Siberian tiger (the largest subspecies) can weigh up to 660 pounds.</li>
               <li> The Sumatran tiger is the smallest, with males only weighing up to 310 pounds. Females generally weigh less than males in all subspecies.</li>
                <li>Tigers are the only cat species that are completely striped. They even have stripes on their skin.</li>
                <li>Stripe density varies by subspecies. The stripes on a Sumatran tiger are closer together than those on any other subspecies.</li>
                <li>No two tigers have the same stripes. Like human fingerprints, their stripe patterns are unique to each individual. Stripes range in color from light brown to black and are not symmetrical</li>
